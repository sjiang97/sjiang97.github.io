Hi Carl,

at the moment, this is not programmed to be within user interaction but it is a good idea for the next version. In the meantime, I did a hack to reproduce the HOT dynamics, including less-than optimal lane usage, by changing some constants in the js/onramp.js and js/onramp_gui.js files and creating a temporary scenario "onrampHOT" (4-lane mainroad+onramp) which can be simulated at http://www.traffic-simulation.de/onrampHOT.html (you can also download the corresponding *HOT* html and js files from my github site and fiddle with the constants, including the number of lanes, which are marked by comments containing HOT).

The main thing I did in the quick hack is to reverted the trucks to car dimensions and driving behaviour and to set a strong bias to the right such that the "trucks" which are now the non-HOT vehicles, nearly exclusively use the two right lanes. By using the "truck percentage" slider, which has now the meaning of a "non-HOV percentage" slider, you can change the fraction of these vehicles. For percentages below about 50-60%, no breakdown occurs but it occurs nearly always if the  non-HOT percentages exceeds 70-80%. Then, you can also  clearly see the inadequate lane usage.


I hope this helps,

Martin

We can assume that those in the HOT lanes have two or more and those in the other lanes only have one and count them.
